## Summary
Based on this analysis, the following findings may be helpful when thinking about mapping this business to Des Moines, IA: 
- Type of User: The majority of users are subscribers. This indicates that users are generally local and are not tourists to this location. 
- Gender: The majority of users are male. This likely doesn't change the business plan a ton, but may play into the size of bikes that are purchased or the ideas that are used in an ad campaign.
- Time of Day: Most rides take place on weekdays during commuting hours (7:00am-9:00am and 5:00pm-7:00pm), indicating that most rides are commuters to work. This trend is larger when observing the male data versus female showing that females may be more likely to use the bikes to run other errands. 
- Location: The heat map shows the largest number of stations clustered in one neighborhood for both the start and end of the ride. Based on the time of day that most bikes are used, these may be larger places of work. 

Prior to moving forward with a business plan, it would also be helpful to analyze the following: 
- Bike Durability: It would be helpful to investigate how many rides have been taken per bike ID. This would help someone interested in the business to understand the life of each bicycle, the main tangible investment that would need to be made into this company. Having more data about bicycle maintenance needs and costs or definitive information about the life of the bikes would give greater insight. 
- Age of User: Looking into the age of users versus the total number of rides taken could give even more insight into who riders of Citi Bike are. Understanding who riders are or are not can inform what time of equipment is purchased, where bike stations are located, etc.
